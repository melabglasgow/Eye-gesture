### Prerequisites

```
pip3 install --user pygame
```

Provided code is written for Python3. After that, you can run the game with:

```
python3 tetris.py
```

* *Arrows* - used for the moving of a tetris block
* *Space*  - rotates the tetris block
* *q*      - quit the game
* *p*      - pause the game
